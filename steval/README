### How to prepare SensorTile Cradle ###

By default a SensorTile devkit has the only BlueNRG module for the any data transfer. This firmware configures SPI pins (standart Arduino SPI pins) as a SPI-slave. 
According the UM2101 User manual, to use the SPI peripheral, use the following solder bridge configuration:
- SB12, SB13, SB14, SB15, SB16 and SB17 ON (connect the signals from Arduino UNO R3 connector)
- SB2, SB3, SB4, SB5, SB6, SB7 OFF (disconnect the signals to the DAC)
- SB1 ON (connect reset signal)

See the devkit scheme (http://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/layouts_and_diagrams/schematic_pack/group0/dd/ce/e9/b5/8c/d1/4c/07/STEVAL-STLKT01V1%20schematic/files/steval-stlkt01v1_schematic.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.steval-stlkt01v1_schematic.pdf) for detales.
