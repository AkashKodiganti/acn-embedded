## Linux ##

This linux project is just one way of using an SDK. 
Dependens is a libsensors4-devel package; 

You can install this library on SUSE like distribution:
zypper in libsensors4-devel
or
apt-get install libsensors4-dev
for Debian like distribution

Actually I wrote it for my laptop. I have a two temperature sensors on CPUs.  
There is no guarantee that this application will work correctly with your machine.
